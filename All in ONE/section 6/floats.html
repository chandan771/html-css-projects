        <p>The Federation coordinates and enhances Paris Fashion Week® and its
            offshoots each year. At the earliest stages, the Federation liaises with the other capitals,
            such as Milan, London and New York, and the other shows in order to guarantee international coherence
            and to remain a true development lever to serve brands. The Federation provides logistical support to
            member and guest brands by negotiating showrooms,
            SACEM fees early on, and can, depending on the brand's profile, offer financial support for shows (DEFI).
        </p>

        <p>Serving the 800 professional buyers, 2000 journalists and 400 photographers, the Federation sets up a
            dedicated workspace,
            the Paris Fashion Week® Center. This information centre draws on a range of partners in order to
            facilitate and enhance everyone's stay in Paris. The Federation gives impetus to these services according to
            needs and with the support of partners and of those registered in order to foster an expertise and
            innovation dynamic.
