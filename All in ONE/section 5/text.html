    <h2>A Blockquote</h2>
    <blockquote>More than 30 million people, including 350 indigenous and ethnic groups, live in
        the Amazon and depend on nature for agriculture, clothing, and traditional medicines.
        There is also a clear link between the health of the Amazon and the health of the planet.
        The rain forests, which contain 90 billion to 140 billion metric tons of carbon, help stabilize local and global
        climate. </blockquote>
