                Nature is made of everything we see around us example trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky,
                mountains,
                forests
                and more.
                Human beings depend on nature to stay alive.
                Nature helps us breathe, gives us food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothes.
                We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.

            <p>Nature is beauty and beauty is Nature. Everywhere Nature is beautiful in one way or the other.
                The beauty of Nature has been a source of inspiration and delight to mankind. It is an endless source of
                joy.
                Dew drops on the green grass look like pearls. Sunrise is a lovely scene of Nature.</p>
